### 3. **Data Configuration**

Choose your data source in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "DataSource": {
    "Type": "Json",
    "FilePath": "Data/documents.json"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Run the Application**

dotnet run
```

### 5. **Live Customization**

Use the `data` command in the app for real-time customization guidance.

### 6. **RAG Configuration**

The `RagDocumentCount` setting in `appsettings.json` controls how many relevant documents are retrieved for each query:

- **Default**: 3 documents (balanced performance and context)
- **Range**: 1-10 documents
- **Lower values (1-2)**: Faster responses, less context, lower costs
- **Higher values (5-10)**: More comprehensive responses, more context, higher costs
- **Recommended**: 3-5 for most business intelligence use cases

**Example configurations in appsettings.json:**

```json
{
  "DataSource": {
    "Type": "Json",
    "FilePath": "Data/documents.json"
  },
  "RagDocumentCount": 3
}
```

**Different use cases:**
