## 🔄 **How It Works - Data Flow**

### **RAG Architecture Overview**

The application uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern with Azure Cognitive Search for intelligent document retrieval:

```
📄 Documents → 🧠 AI Embeddings → 🔍 Search Index → 💬 User Query → 🎯 Similarity Search → 🤖 AI Response
```

### **Data Flow Process**

1. **📄 Document Processing**:

   - Load documents from JSON/CSV/text files
   - Generate AI embeddings (1536-dimensional vectors) for each document
   - Create `KnowledgeDocument` objects with text + vector data

2. **🔍 Index Creation**:

   - Create Azure Cognitive Search index with vector search capabilities
   - Upload documents using `IndexDocumentsBatch.Upload()`
   - Store both text fields and vector embeddings for hybrid search

3. **💬 Query Processing**:

   - Convert user questions to AI embeddings
   - Perform vector similarity search in Azure Cognitive Search
   - Retrieve most relevant documents based on semantic similarity

4. **🤖 Response Generation**:
   - Use retrieved context + user question to generate AI responses
   - Leverage Azure OpenAI for intelligent answer generation

### **Key Technical Features**

- **Vector Search**: 1536-dimensional embeddings for semantic understanding
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines keyword and vector similarity for best results
- **Configurable Retrieval**: Adjustable number of documents retrieved per query (1-10, default: 3)
- **Auto-Indexing**: Automatic search index creation and document upload
- **Real-time Processing**: Live embedding generation and search operations
- **Scalable Architecture**: Works with 5 to thousands of documents
