# 🔧 Quick Start: Customizing Your AI Assistant

## What You Can Do

Your Universal RAG Assistant is **incredibly flexible**! You can transform it into ANY comparison or information tool by simply changing the data files.

## 🚀 Instant Customization

### Step 1: Choose Your Topic

The app can become an expert in ANY field:

- 🛒 **Food Pricing**: Grocery stores, market prices
- 🏠 **Real Estate**: Property prices, rental markets
- 💻 **Technology**: Electronics pricing, product comparisons
- 🎵 **Entertainment**: Concerts, streaming, movies
- 🚗 **Automotive**: Car prices, dealer comparisons
- 🏨 **Travel**: Hotel rates, restaurant prices
- 🎓 **Education**: Course fees, university costs
- 🛍️ **Shopping**: Any product category you want

### Step 2: Replace the Data

Simply edit `Data/documents.json` with your content:

**Current**: Belgian real estate

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "BELGIAN REAL ESTATE ASSISTANT",
    "icon": "🏠",
    "flag": "🇧🇪",
    "welcomeMessage": "Welcome to your personal Belgian real estate assistant!",
    "capabilityDescription": "I can help you find the best property deals...",
    "additionalInfo": "Compare prices across different cities..."
  },
  "documents": [
    {
      "Id": "1",
      "Title": "Brussels Real Estate - Apartment Rental Prices by District",
      "Content": "Ixelles rental prices: 1-bedroom €800-1200/month..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Transform to Food Pricing**:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "BELGIAN FOOD PRICING ASSISTANT",
    "icon": "🛒",
    "flag": "🇧🇪",
    "welcomeMessage": "Welcome to your personal Belgian food pricing assistant!",
    "capabilityDescription": "I can help you find the best deals on fruits, vegetables...",
    "additionalInfo": "Compare prices across different stores..."
  },
  "documents": [
    {
      "Id": "1",
      "Title": "Fresh Fruits Prices in Belgium - Store Comparison",
      "Content": "Belgian apple prices by retailer: Delhaize €3.20/kg..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Run the App

```bash
dotnet run
```

**That's it!** The AI will automatically:

- ✅ Load your new content
- ✅ Generate smart embeddings
- ✅ Create a searchable index
- ✅ Answer questions about YOUR topic

## 📋 Example Data Files Included

I've created sample files to demonstrate the flexibility:

1. **`documents-realestate-example.json`** - Belgian property market
2. **`documents-technology-example.json`** - Electronics pricing

To try them:

```bash
# Backup current data
cp Data/documents.json Data/documents-food-backup.json

# Try real estate data
cp Data/documents-realestate-example.json Data/documents.json

# Run the app
dotnet run
```

## 🎯 What Happens When You Change documents.json?

### The Magic Process:

1. **🔄 App Restart**: Next time you run the app
2. **📊 Data Loading**: Your new content is loaded automatically
3. **🧠 AI Processing**: New embeddings generated for smart search
4. **🔍 Index Creation**: Search index rebuilt with your data
5. **💬 AI Adaptation**: Assistant becomes expert in YOUR topic

### Built-in Commands:

- All styling and features work with ANY topic!

## 📈 Advanced Features

### Multiple Data Sources

Edit `appsettings.json` to use:

### Smart Content Recognition

The AI automatically highlights:

- 💰 **Prices** (€/kg, €/month, €/hour) in yellow

3. **Keywords**: Use terms your users will search for
4. **Document Size**: Keep under 2000 characters each
